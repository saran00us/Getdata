The codebook guides you through the 5 step process of creating a tidy data set using data collected from the
accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone


The R script called run_analysis.R does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for 
each activity and each subject.

6. creates an output tidydata.txt containing the tidy dataset


Output

creates an output tidydata.txt file
